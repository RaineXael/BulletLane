OKAY SO
Each enemy has an attackpattermnanager class
that contains a list of attack patterns, which
are a collection of attacks.
Each attack is like these:
	Bullet: Speed and angle.
	PlayerFollowingBullet: Speed & a toggle for following player + prediction or not
	Wait: A wait timer, before it goes to the next attack. Good for different patterns per attack.
	Each attackpattern in the attack pattern manager would have a repeat counter and possibly a wait float until it goes to the next.
	
	tl;dk
	AttackPatternmanager => AttackPattern[]
	AttackPattern => Attack[]
	
	Each attack is a declaration of what bullet to spawn and where
	and whatnot.
	
	yeah
	
	sounds sane enough,,,
